### Libraries & Packages

I used these libraries and packages to develop this app;

- [MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/) for design.
- [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) for creating unique ids for tasks.
- [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) for drag&drop feature.
- [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) for icons.
- [react-toastify](https://github.com/fkhadra/react-toastify) for toast notification.

Also, I used [prettier](https://prettier.io/) plugin for formatting my code.
